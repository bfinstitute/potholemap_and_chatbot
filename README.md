# potholemap_and_chatbot
This will contain the relevant information for the AI Chatbot prototype.

It will allow for users to speak directly to an AI Chatbot,
have the map update directly from the user's input.

For example a user might 'Please show me the ten nearest potholes to my location',
which will then directly update the map to show the ten nearest potholes to the location.
